___

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to create a virtual machine for this build process, Although the build process can be done on your Real PC.<br>
> It's not recommended on your Real PC because sometimes the conflicts may happen and broke the whole compilation process.<br>
> **VMWare/Hyper-V are recommended to run the Virtual Machine due to their performance. VirtualBox will probably work too.**

## Prerequisite Setup
1. Install DirectX SDK June 2010
2. Install 7-Zip
3. Install Visual Studio 2012
   - Uncheck all optional components in the installer **except "Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++"** to save space, none of them are needed for the build.
4. Install Update 4 for Visual Studio 2012
5. Install Incredibuild 4.0 (Only needed for compiling shaders and scripts)
   - If you encounter the error that the installer is "Blocked by your administrator", follow these steps:
      1. Hold Shift and right click the `incredibuild4_0.exe` file, select "Copy as path"
      2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
      3. Paste the path and press Enter
   - Select to install "Incredibuild Agent", "Incredibuild Coordinator", and the extension for Visual Studio.
6. Install OpenIV
7. Install [DLL Patches and Rush Patches](#miscellaneous)
8. (OPTIONAL) Install 3D Studio Max 2010 SDK
9. Create X:\ Drive by following the steps at the bottom:
    1. Open Command Prompt
    2. Create a new folder called "GTA" to the Desktop or anywhere that you want.
    3. Run `net use X: \\localhost\c$\<Path to working folder for build> /persistent:yes`
       - Example: `net use X: \\localhost\c$\Users\abcd\Desktop\GTA /persistent:yes` 
10. Create the folder `X:\gta5` and copy all folders from `GTAVSP.7z\GTA V Source` into it
11. Right click the folder `X:\gta5`, select "Properties", uncheck "Read-only", click Apply then OK.
12. Copy all folders in `dll_patches_x.zip` to `X:\gta5\tools_ng\bin`, make sure to overwrite when copying.
13. (OPTIONAL) Install 3rdParty Folder, Extract and Put the folder to `X:\gta5\`.
14. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run the following commands, then close:
```batch
setx /m RS_TOOLSROOT X:\gta5\tools_ng
setx /m DXSDK_DIR "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)"
setx /m RS_CODEBRANCH X:\gta5\src\dev_ng
setx /m RS_PROJECT gta5
```
15. To ensure changes are finalized, restart build machine/computer.

**By the end, Your Folder Structure should look like this:**
```
üñ•Ô∏è X:
 ‚îó üìÇ gta5
    ‚î£ üìÇ 3rdParty (OPTIONAL)
    ‚î£ üìÇ src
    ‚î£ üìÇ script
    ‚îó üìÇ tools_ng
```

## Patching The Source Code
1. Open `rush_patches-master.zip`
2. Copy `game` and `rage` folders to `X:\gta5\src\dev_ng`, make sure to overwrite when copying.
3. (OPTIONAL) To skip launcher requirement for running the game, copy `game` and `rage` folders from `rush_patches-master.zip\OPTIONAL_FIXES` to the same folder.

## Building The Game Binary
1. Run `X:\gta5\src\dev_ng\game\VS_Project\load_sln_unity_2012.bat`
	- If prompted with "How do you want to open this file?", check "Always use this app to open .sln files" and Select **Visual Studio 2012** then click OK.
2. Once the solution loads, open the dropdown menu that says "Debug" at the top, select "Configuration Manager"
3. Change "Active Solution Platform" to "x64" and close the configuration window.
4. Hold Ctrl key and click all projects under "GameLibs" and "Rage" folder, right-click and select "Properties".
5. In the "Configuration" dropdown, select "All Configurations".
6. Select `C/C++ > All options`, under "Look for options or switches", search "err" and set "Treat Warnings as Errors" to "No (/WX-)", then click "Apply" and "OK".
   - For faster compiles, search "mul" and set "Multiprocessor Compilation" to "Yes (/MP)"
      - If you get the error `C1060: Compiler is out of heap space` during build, come back to the above setting and turn it off.
7. Right-click the "game" project and select "Properties" and do step 5 again.
8. Change build the type at the top of the window from "Debug" to "BankRelease".
9. At the top of the window, select `Build > Build Solution` and wait for build to finish.
10. Copy output binary to game folder.

> [!WARNING]
> Building shaders and scripts can be skipped using the [prebuilt files above](#prebuilt-files).<br>
> These steps are here to allow modding or for those who prefer to build from source as much as possible.

## Building Shaders
1. Under "Shaders", right click the "shaders_rc" project and click "Build"
2. (OPTIONAL) Build low quality shaders
   1. Right click the "shaders_rc" project and click "Properties"
   2. Select `Configuration Properties > NMake`
   3. Under "General", change all command lines from ending with `win32_40.bat` to ending with `win32_40_lq.bat`, then click "Apply" and "OK".
   4. Rebuild shaders and wait it to finish.
3. Copy `X:\gta5\titleupdate\dev_ng\common` to game directory.

## Building Game Scripts
1. Open Command Prompt and Run the following commands:
```batch
X:
cd X:\gta5\src\dev_ng
setenv
cd ..\..\tools_ng\bin\RageScriptEditor
ragScriptEditor
```
3. In the editor, select `File > Open Project` and open `X:\gta5\script\dev_ng\singleplayer\GTA5_SP.scproj`.
4. Select `Compiling > Intellibuild > Build Project`.


## Patching Game Assets

#### Putting update.rpf and update2.rpf
1. Install ``update.rpf and update2.rpf from GTA V build 2699`` from [Requirements](#requirements)
2. Put `update.rpf` and `update2.rpf` files to `<Game Directory>\update\` folder.
   * **Dont forget to backup your old files from update folder.**


#### Modifying the RPF Files
If you ever modify the RPF files, dont forget to encrpyt them.<br>
Here you can see how to do it:

1. From `rush_patches-master.zip`, copy all files in the `ARCHIVEFIX` folder to a separate location
2. Drag RPF file(s) onto `ArchiveFix.exe`
   * Don't drag the both files at the same time, **just drag one by one**, This will not work with that way.

#### Replacing script.rpf
If did you compiled the scripts and want to put it to the game, here you can follow this steps in order to make scripts work:

1. Run OpenIV, select "Windows"
2. Select the game folder and click "Continue"
3. Open `<Game Directory>\update\update2.rpf\x64\levels\gta5\script`
4. Delete `script.rpf`
5. Click the "Edit mode" button, and copy `X:\gta5\titleupdate\dev_ng\x64\levels\gta5\script\script.rpf` to the OpenIV window.

<!-- This can be skipped because i already included everything in the update.rpf and update2.rpf.

1. (OPTIONAL) Fix Story Mode by following the steps at the bottom:
   1. Open `<Game Directory>\update\update.rpf\common\data` and make sure "Edit Mode" is enabled
   2. Under "XML Text Files", right-click `gameconfig.xml` and click "Edit"
   3. Under "Search", type "51000"
   4. Change the value of `51000` to `53000`
   5. Click "Save"
2. Close OpenIV

## Running The Game
1. In the game directory, create a file named `launch.bat` and add these contents:
```batch
cd %~dp0
game_win64_bankrelease.exe -noSocialClub -nokeyboardhook -nonetlogs
```
2. (OPTIONAL) Add additional arguments:
 - `-kbgame` - Start game with game keyboard enabled.
 - `-output` - Show console log of game.
 - `-rag` - Enable support for RAG, the internal game debugging tool.
    - `-ragUseOwnWindow` - Use it with `-rag` parameter to make game run outside of RAG Render Window.
    - **DO NOT** Forget to Launch RAG Before launching the game if u using any RAG parameters.
 - `-DoReleaseStartup` - Start real Story Mode on launch, Ignore if it says unknown parameter/command.
    - If you dont type this parameter, you will spawned in a random location as a random character with a random clothes. 
 - Additional standard game arguments can be added as well.
   - [Here is the almost all the arguments list](other/LAUNCHPARAMS_GTAV.txt) 
3. (OPTIONAL) Launch RAG with the following commands in Command Prompt:
```batch
X:
cd X:\gta5\src\dev_ng
setenv
cd ..\..\tools_ng\bin\rag
rag
```
4. Run `launch.bat`
